PwingRaces is a highly customizable races plugin for Minecraft featuring customizable skilltrees, triggers and abilities. 

## Customization
PwingRaces was designed with customization in mind, but also in a way that allows you to take it to it's potential while not being too complex.
Races in this plugin aren't hardcoded whatsoever, allowing you to make whatever race you please. While it comes with a couple races out of the box, you are free to create, customize and design your own races however you please.

Here are a couple examples that come with the plugin: https://github.com/Pwing-Minecraft/PwingRaces/tree/master/races.
